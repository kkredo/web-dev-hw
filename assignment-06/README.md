1. The most common types of forms I come across on the web often are mailing
list subscriptions. They usually pop up when I first enter the site or on the Contact and or About pages. Other forms I have seen a lot are shipping info forms when completing an online order. The main purpose of both of these forms is to collect information about the customer or user so that they can be contacted in the future.

3. For this assignment I continued my normal work flow which involves first watching the video walkthrough and taking notes on new content. I then go to the website materials and collect information on what tags and markups I want to include in my assignment. After this I physically map out what I want the page to look like, this helps me keep track of what I need to do and where select elements will go and what not.
