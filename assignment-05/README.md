# Assignment 5
## Kyle Kredo

1) A page can only have one of each. This is because the head is the container for processing info and contains lots of high level information that is always first with the root element. Because the body is within the head, there can only be one. Having more makes those invalid and the processor will have trouble displaying them.
2) The difference between structural markup and semantic markup is that structural markup defines the structure and layout of the page. When we add or remove tags this does not change the structure, so these are semantic markups. Structural markup creates the layout of the page while semantic markup edits and alters the structure of page elements and content.
3) For this assignment I started by first watching the assignment walkthrough. I then read most of the information on the course site that was new to me and noted of them. I then physically mapped out what this page would look like. I then began to write the code for the page, having to refer to the walkthrough every now and then. I am pleased with what I learned today! I struggled with some of the new semantic markup techniques as where to place them, but caught on quickly.
