1. The web is different than the internet in that the web is a portion of the internet. The internet is composed of multiple networks, the web
being one of them. Each internet computer is independent, but the web is interconnected via hyperlinks.

2. The internet functions as a large infrastructure of networks. Computers are not inherently connected to each other but can be connected
via wires or more likely, wireless options such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. However, on a larger scale computers must be connected via routers, 
modems, and ISP's. This creates a huge network of connectivity.

3. A directory is basically a file on a computer. It is a location where information about files is being held where related files are held 
together. 

4. Using a VCS provides a number of benefits including better workflow and collaboration of projects, better saving and storing of files, 
restoring work, and better backup of work.
