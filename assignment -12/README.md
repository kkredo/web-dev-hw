# Assignment-12
## Kyle Kredo

1. My "imaginary" client for this assignment was actually myself. Rambler Co. is
a personal project I have been working on for the last couple of months. My goal
is to create a successful clothing company revolving around my passions and experiences.
This website is not really how I want the end product to look like, that will take
much more time and probably some professional help. But the ideas, color palette,
and images are all the same. I want a clean, yet bold site that is modern yet classic
and unrefined. Simple and bold colors, and a large focus on imagery.
2. Display: Inline requires elements to act like inline elements. Inline elements
ignore width properties, and only take up as much horizontal space as needed. They also do not create
new lines and flow with the content on the screen, meaning that they do not obey margins. We
also cannot change the vertical distance between themselves and other elements.
Inline: Block elements also removes new lines but does respect margins. These elements
will expand horizontally to fit the container, so the width must be set.
Block elements can be derived from inline elements and can create nav bar lists.
3. My work flow for this assignment consisted of going through the website materials and
collecting information on what elements I wanted to include in my site. I also referenced alot
from the videos and also from past assignments.
