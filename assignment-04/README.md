1) I visited a site called The Ultimate Band List. It is from 1996 and the setup is pretty basic. There are a few graphics but other than that the site is really primitive. Not too much to see or catch attention. The type and fonts are all very basic too.
2) From the GIT module I was able to learn alot and I find it very helpful. There are some things that are difficult and take me some time to figure out even with the module there, but overall i like it.
