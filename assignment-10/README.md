# Assignment 10

1. A system font is a type face that is already on the user's server while a web font is a custom typeface hosted on a server. These do not have to be available on a user's server to view, but they do require certain elements to appear. Web-safe fonts are those that are both Window and MAC friendly. This ensures the user has the font on their system and allows for faster load time.
2. Fallbacks or font stacks are important because it will ensure that the document will have some sort of font if the desired one is not compatible with the user's system. They are a type of element insurance, making sure a default font will show.
3. My work cycle for this assignment involved first watching the video and building my page from that. I then viewed the example site and source and utilized some of those elements in my page. I had to do some digging around for my image element and had to edit it in Photoshop so it had no background.
