# Assignment 08
## Kyle Kredo

1. Learning HTML has been quite the ride. It is still tricky for me
at times, but I have noticed how with each assignment I am becoming
more and more comfortable. It is very time consuming for me and I
would like to become quicker at it. I love being able to style
my pages more and I really do have a new appreciation for my favorite sites and the amount of styling that goes into those.
2. I am excited to learn more CSS and styling methods to make my sites look more professional. I feel that our pages now look really
outdated and unprofessional. I would like to learn more about fonts and imaging.
3. For this assignment I watched the walkthrough video and took notes. I then went through my old pages and mapped out what elements I could use and edit to fit this assignment. I then began to piece it all together.
