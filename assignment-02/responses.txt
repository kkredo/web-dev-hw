1. Data travels through the internet by chopping said data into smaller pieces
known as packets. Each packet travels through the network in a series of hops.
First the packets go through a wireless router, then to a modem, hops to an ISP,
long haul provider using BGP (Border Gateway Patrol) and then to the recipient's
ISP where the packets are then put back into a coherent message.

2. The relationship between an IP address and DNS is that the DNS translates

their respective domain names.
