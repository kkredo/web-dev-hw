 This was pretty challenging for me. I was successfully able to add more platforms, change the gravity of the stars, change the sprite, and added new graphics. The sprite sheet had to be uploaded into photoshop where I selected the individual frames I wanted and recreated my own sheet. It is a bit off when the player goes left and the frames can skip. The new diamond graphics are meant to be collected but the collect function would make the whole game bug out. I tried for a bit to weed out the issue but I could not. I struggled alot with trying to make the sprite jump with a space bar. I watched alot of YouTube videos and read through alot of coding forums and found some code that I tried. I was just confused because I feel that I had to set the input not as a cursor key but rather a button? I tried that and that did not work so I then tried going directly to the cursor function and replacing up with spacebar and even cursors with keys and then buttons and no luck. I tried to then add another if then statement as well as attempting to add my spacebar to the anim function. I do see how this can be really fun for someone into gaming! It was really cool to see how a simple game can be created fairly quickly.
