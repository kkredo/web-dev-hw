# Assignment 09
## Kyle Kredo

1. Universal selectors set style for all elements on the page while element, class, and id selectors set styles for select types. Element selectors pertain to all elements of a certain type while class selectors pertain to elements that function the same. ID selectors pertain to specific elements by calling unique ID's. Universal selectors are great if you want the whole page to have the same style, but the rest are better if you want to set separate and unique styles each element.

2. In this page I used 3 main colors all of which were pulled from the Elton John painting. The orange color, F77E24, is a pretty typical 70's type orange. Reminds me of my grandparents' shag carpet. The yellow, F2BC37, goes with the orange. Orange and yellow, a 70's staple. The green is actually really cool, 597B6A, and contrasts nicely off the yellow and orange.

3. My work cycle for this assignment consisted of watching the assignment walkthrough video. I then reviewed the website and took notes of elements that I could use in this page. I then physically drew out the site to plan out how I wanted it to look. I would review the example page source as well for reference of what I need to do.
