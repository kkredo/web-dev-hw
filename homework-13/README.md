# Assignment 13
## Kyle Kredo


This was not too bad! I did have to do some searching on how to get the objects to move based on movement of the mouse. Once I found that I did use a lot of that code, I changed the dimensions of the squares and the rotation of the camera along with the spacing between them. I had to add the js for this as well. I struggled with the model however. I got a tiny model to pop up on the preview screen but not on the actual site which I could not figure out why. What was really cool about this assignment was prior to this I had no idea that 3D models were a thing. I had more fun going through model sites and looking at the amazing work people make. I cannot even fathom how they did it but it was so cool. I love Star Wars and it was so cool to see such realistic recreations of storm trooper helmets and stuff like that.
