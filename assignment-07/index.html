    <h1>Lyrics</h1>
    <p><br>Oh baby,
I bet you're wondering, how I knew<br>
About your plans to make me blue<br>
With some other guy you knew before<br>
Between the two of us guys, you know love you more<br>
You took me by surprise<br>
I must say<br>
When I found out yesterday<br><br>
Chorus<br><br>
Don't you know heard it through the grapevine<br>
Not that sure you'll be mine<br>
I heard it through the grapevine<br>
And honey, I'm about to lose my mind<br><br>
Ooh you know a man ain't suppose to cry<br>
But these tears I can't hold inside<br>
Losing you would end my life you see<br>
Because you mean that much to me<br>
You could have told me yourself<br>
That you've gone and found someone else<br><br>

Chorus<br><br>

People say they hide from what you see<br>
So, in love with what you hear<br>
I've been hurt I've been confused<br>
But if it's true, won't you tell me dear<br>
Do you plan to let me go<br>
For another guy who says he loves you more<br><br>

Repeat Chorus<br><br>
