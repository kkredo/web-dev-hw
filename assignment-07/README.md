# Assignment 07
## Kyle Kredo

1. Divs are the main block in which the elements can be placed in. ids allow for
organization and identification of the div, classes can be attributed to a div
and can be a styling attribute. Only one id per div but can have multiple classes.
Spans are inline elements and further divide divs.

2. Alt text is written description of the embedded image. It is
for users who are visually impaired and cannot see the image.

3. My work flow for this assignment started with reading the materials on the
course website and note taking of the new material. I then watched the walkthrough
and took notes and even did some work while watching. Once I started my coding
in Atom I would refer to the site and walkthrough.
